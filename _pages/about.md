Hi, I'm Linh or Levi. I am going to become a first year PhD student about Machine Learning at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute, Deakin University. I graduated from University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi, with an first-class degree in Information Technology's (Honors Program) degree. 

My research interest is about Machine Learning problems, especially in Statistical Machine Learning. Now, I'm learning about Reinforcement Learning and Generative Models.
