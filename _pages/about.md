Hi, I'm Linh or Levi. I am a first year PhD student about Machine Learning at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2), Deakin University, advised by [Prof. Sunil Gupta](https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~sunilg/) and [Dr. Hung Tran The](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=um-FS-gAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I graduated from University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi, with an first-class degree in Information Technology's (Honors Program). 

My research interests are about Machine Learning problems. I'm focussing on Reinforcement Learning problems in Offline setting, Transfer Learning, and Generalization with the aim to develop Sample-efficient RL algorithms.
