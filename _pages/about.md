Hi, I'm Linh or Levi. I am a first year PhD student about Machine Learning at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2), Deakin University under the supervised of [Prof. Sunil Gupta](https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~sunilg/) and [Dr. Hung Tran The](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=um-FS-gAAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated from University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi, with an first-class degree in Information Technology's (Honors Program). 

My research interest is about Machine Learning problems, especially in Statistical Machine Learning. Now, I'm learning and researching about Reinforcement Learning (Offline setting) and Generative Models.
